## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use strict mode settings

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for code formatting: `yarn format`
- Follow ESLint rules: `yarn lint`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper prop types
- Implement error boundaries where appropriate

### Redux

- Use Redux Toolkit for state management
- Create typed slices and selectors
- Use async thunks for API calls
- Keep state normalized

### File Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/         # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/             # Next.js pages (if using pages router)
â”œâ”€â”€ app/               # Next.js app router
â”œâ”€â”€ services/          # Business logic and API calls
â”œâ”€â”€ store/             # Redux store and slices
â”œâ”€â”€ types/             # TypeScript type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/             # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/             # Custom React hooks
â””â”€â”€ theme/             # MUI theme configuration
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Components**: Use PascalCase
- **Functions**: Use camelCase
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Types/Interfaces**: Use PascalCase with descriptive names

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for components
- Write E2E tests for critical user flows
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update type definitions
- Include examples in documentation

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(dashboard): add real-time metrics chart
fix(connection): handle connection timeout errors
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Release Process

We use **Semantic Release** for automated versioning and releases:

1. **Make your changes** following conventional commit format
2. **Create a pull request** to `main` branch
3. **After merge**, GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Analyze commits to determine version bump
   - Generate CHANGELOG.md
   - Create GitHub release with notes
   - Build and push Docker image to Docker Hub
   - Tag the release with semantic version

**No manual version updates needed!** The CI/CD pipeline handles everything based on commit messages.
